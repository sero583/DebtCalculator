#  DebtCalculator

This is a very basic and small console-application. This was created for my computer science class Java OOP1.

## Usage

* Download the JAR at the top of this repository
* Execute the command: `java -jar DebtCalculator.jar <double: totalDebt> <double: interestRate (>0 && <1)> <int: months>` 
* E.g. for a credit of 100â‚¬ with an interest rate of 2% and a time of 12 months, you do the following command:<br>
`java -jar DebtCalculator.jar 100 0.02 12`
